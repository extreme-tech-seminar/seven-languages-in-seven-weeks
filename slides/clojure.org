** Interview with Rich Hickey
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Clojure is designed to be a practical tool for general-purpose
production programming by developers in industry and as such adds
these additional objectives to the Lisps of old. We work better in
teams, we play well with other languages, and we solve some
traditional Lisp problems.

**** Using Loop & Recur
#+begin_src clojure
  (loop [x x-initial-value,
         y y-initial-value]
    (do-something-with x y))

  (loop [x 1] x)
  ;; 1

  (defn size [v]
    (loop [l v, c 0]
      (if (empty? l)
        c
        (recur (rest l) (inc c)))))
#+end_src
** Sequences
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A sequence is an implementation-independent abstraction around all the
various containers in the Clojure ecosystem. Sequences wrap all
Clojure collections (sets, maps, vectors, and the like), strings, and
even file system structures (streams, directories). They also provide
a common abstraction for Java containers, including Java collections,
arrays, and strings. In general, if it supports the functions =first=,
=rest=, and =cons=, you can wrap it in a sequence.
#+END_QUOTE
** List Comprehensions
#+begin_src clojure
  (def colors ["red" "blue"])
  (def toys ["block" "car"])

  (for [x colors] (str "I like " x))
  ;; ("I like red" "I like blue")

  (for [x colors, y toys] (str "I like " x " " y "s"))
  ;; ("I like red blocks" "I like red cars"
  ;;  "I like blue blocks" "I like blue cars")

  (defn small-world? [w] (< (count w) 4))
  (for [x colors, y toys, :when (small-word? y)]
    (str "I like " x " " y "s"))
  ;; ("I like red cars" "I like blue cars")
#+end_src
** Lazy Evaluation
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Clojure's sequence library computes values only when they are actually
consumed.
#+END_QUOTE
** Finite Sequences with range
#+begin_src clojure
(range 1 10)
;; (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
(range 1 10 3)
;; (1 4 7)
(range 10)
;; (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
#+end_src
** Infinite Sequences and take
#+begin_src clojure
(take 3 (repeat "Use the Force, Luke"))
;; ("Use the Force, Luke" "Use the Force, Luke" "Use the Force, Luke")
(take 5 (cycle [:lather :rinse :repeat]))
;; (:lather :rinse :repeat :lather :rinse)

(->> [:lather :rinse :repeat] (cycle) (drop 2) (take 5))
;; (:repeat :lather :rinse :repeat :lather)

(defn factorial [n] (apply * (take n (iterate inc 1))))
(factorial 5)
;; 120
#+end_src
** defrecord and protocols
- Protocols :: define a contract, similar to a Java interface. Types
               of a protocol will support a specific set of functions,
               fields, and arguments.
- Records :: define an type, similar to a Java class, that can
             implement a protocol.
** Protocol example
#+begin_src clojure
  (defprotocol Compass
    (direction [c])
    (left [c])
    (right [c]))

  (def directions [:north :east :south :west])

  (defn turn
    [base amount]
    (rem (+ base amount) (count directions)))

  (defrecord SimpleCompass [bearing]
    Compass
    (direction [_] (directions bearing))
    (left [_] (SimpleCompass. (turn bearing 3)))
    (right [_] (SimpleCompass. (turn bearing 1)))
    Object
    (toString [this] (str "[" (direction this) "]")))
#+end_src
** Macros
*** Defining =unless= as a function
#+begin_src clojure
  (defn unless [test body]
    (if (not test) body))

  (unless true (println "Danger, danger Will Robinson"))
  ;; Danger, danger Will Robinson
  ;; nil
#+end_src
*** Defining =unless= as a macro
#+begin_src clojure
  (defmacro unless [test body]
    (list 'if (list 'not test) 'body))

  (macroexpand '(unless condition body))
  ;; (if (not condition) body)

  (unless true (println "No more danger, Will."))
  ;; nil
#+end_src
* Day 3
** Day 3: An Eye for Evil
** Locks & Transactions
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
Modern databases use at least two types of concurrency control:

- Locks :: prevent two competing transactions from accessing the same
           row at the same time.

- Versioning ::  uses multiple versions to allow each transaction to
                 have a private copy of its data. If any transaction
                 interferes with another, the database engine simply
                 reruns that transaction.
#+END_QUOTE
** Locking vs. STM
- Languages like Java use locking to protect the resources of one
  thread from competing threads that might corrupt them. Locking
  basically puts the burden of concurrency control on the programmer.
  We are rapidly learning that this burden is too much to bear.

- Languages like Clojure use software transactional memory (STM). This
  strategy uses multiple versions to maintain consistency and
  integrity.
** References
1. A *ref* (reference) is a wrapped piece of data.
2. All access must conform to specified rules to support STM.
3. You cannot change a reference outside of a transaction.
** Working with References
#+begin_src clojure
  (def movie (ref "Star Wars"))

  (deref movie)
  ;; "Star Wars"
  @movie
  ;; "Star Wars"

  (alter movie str ": The Empire Strikes Back")
  ;; java.lang.IllegalStateException: No transaction running (NO_SOURCE_FILE:0)

  (dosync (alter movie str ": The Empire Strikes Back"))
  ;; "Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"

  (dosync (ref-set movie "Star Wars: The Revenge of the Sith"))
  ;; "Star Wars: The Revenge of the Sith"

  @movie
  ;; "Star Wars: The Revenge of the Sith"
#+end_src

** Atoms
1. An *atom* is a wrapped piece of data.
2. Allows change outside the context of a transaction.
3. Useful to provide thread-safety for a *single reference*.

** Working with Atoms
#+begin_src clojure
  (def danger (atom "Split at your own risk."))

  @danger
  ;; "Split at your own risk."

  (reset! danger "Split with impunity")
  ;; "Split with impunity"

  @danger
  ;; "Split with impunity"

  (def top-sellers (atom []))
  (swap! top-sellers conj {:title "Seven Languages", :author "Tate"})
  ;; [{:title "Seven Languages", :author "Tate"}]
  (swap! top-sellers conj {:title "Programming Clojure", :author "Halloway"})
  ;; [{:title "Seven Languages", :author "Tate"}
  ;;  {:title "Programming Clojure", :author "Halloway"}]
#+end_src

** Building an Atom Cache
#+begin_src clojure
  (ns solutions.atom-cache
    (:refer-clojure :exclude [get]))

  (defn create
    []
    (atom {}))

  (defn get
    [cache key]
    (@cache key))

  (defn put
    ([cache value-map]
       (swap! cache merge value-map))
    ([cache key value]
       (swap! cache assoc key value)))
  (def ac (create))
  (put ac :quote "I'm your father, Luke.")
  (println (str "Cached item: " (get ac :quote)))
#+end_src

** Agents
1. Like an *atom*, an *agent* is a wrapped piece of data.
2. Like a *future*, the state of a dereferenced agent will block until
   a value is available.
3. Users can mutate the data *asynchronously* using functions, and the
   updates will occur in another thread.
4. Only one function can mutate the state of an agent at a time.

** Working with Agents

:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.3
:END:
#+begin_src clojure
  (def tribbles (agent 1))

  (defn twice [x] (* 2 x))
  (send tribbles twice)
  @tribbles
  ;; 2

  (defn slow-twice [x]
    (do
      (Thread/sleep 5000)
      (* 2 x)))
  (send tribbles slow-twice)
  @tribbles
  ;; 2

  ;; -*- 5 seconds later -*-
  @tribbles
  ;; 4
#+end_src

*** Right                                                           :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.7
:END:
- You will get *a* value of =tribbles=. You may not get the latest
  changes from your own thread.
- If you want to be sure to get the latest value *with respect to your
  own thread*, you can call =(await tribbles)= or =(await-for timeout
  tribbles)=.

Clojure’s tools involve working with a snapshot whose value is
instantaneous and potentially out-of-date immediately. That’s exactly
how versioning databases work for fast concurrency control.

** Futures
A future is a concurrency construct that allows an asynchronous return
before computation is complete.

Creating a future returns a reference immediately, starting the
computation in another thread. Dereferencing the reference blocks
until the computation completes.

#+begin_src clojure
  (def finer-things (future (Thread/sleep 5000) "take time"))

  @finer-things
  ;; -*- After 5 seconds -*-
  ;; "take time"
#+end_src

1. Metadata
2. Java Integration
3. Multimethods
4. Thread State

* Wrapping Up

** Wrapping Up
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Clojure combines the power of a Lisp dialect with the convenience of
the JVM. From the JVM, Clojure benefits from the existing community,
deployment platform, and code libraries. As a Lisp dialect, Clojure
comes with the corresponding strengths and limitations.
#+END_QUOTE
** Wrapping Up: Strengths
1. A Good Lisp
2. Concurrency
3. Java Integration
4. Lazy Evaluation
5. Data as Code
** Wrapping Up: Weaknesses
1. Prefix Notation
2. Readability
3. Learning Curve
4. Limited Lisp
5. Accessibility
** Final Thoughts
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Most of Clojure’s strengths and weaknesses are related to the power
and flexibility.

If you need an extreme programming model and are willing to pay the
price of learning the language, Clojure is a great fit. I think this
is a great language for disciplined, educated teams looking for
leverage. You can build better software faster with Clojure.
